### Tools

## AI Detectors

- [GPTZero](https://gptzero.me/) - An app that can quickly and efficiently detect whether an essay is ChatGPT or human written
- [DetectGPT](https://github.com/eric-mitchell/detect-gpt) - Zero-Shot Machine-Generated Text Detection using Probability Curvature
- [AI Content Detector - Copyleaks](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ai-content-detector-copyl/gplcmncpklkdjiccbknjjkoidpgkcakd) - Verify what content was written by a human or an AI chatbot with the AI Content Detector Chrome extension from Copyleaks.
- [ai-text-classifier](https://platform.openai.com/ai-text-classifier) - The AI Text Classifier **(from OpenAI)** is a fine-tuned GPT model that predicts how likely it is that a piece of text was generated by AI from a variety of sources, such as ChatGPT.
- [Hello-SimpleAI/chatgpt-detector-roberta](https://huggingface.co/Hello-SimpleAI/chatgpt-detector-roberta) - The base checkpoint is roberta-base. We train it with all [Hello-SimpleAI/HC3](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Hello-SimpleAI/HC3) data (without held-out) for 1 epoch.
